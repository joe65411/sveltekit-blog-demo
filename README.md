# svelte-kit-blog-demo
A starting point for anyone looking to create a simple static blog, with some dynamic pages and elements using Sveltekit. I showcase how I created this demo on my [blog](youash.com), for anyone interested in learning how to create their own from scratch. However, this is also a great template for anyone who wants a quick blog already set up and ready for build and deployment.

Of course, it's by no means perfect so if you want to contribute in any way that would be very much appreciated.
